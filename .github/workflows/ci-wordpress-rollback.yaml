# Pipeline to rollback the release by one version back.
# In order to rollback release by one step back, you need to run this workflow.
# During the workflow, a symbolic link pointing to the current release version will switch to the previous release version.
# During release delivery, a folder is created with a timestamp corresponding to when the release was delivered.
